Therefore,  operators  are  required  to  provide  all \nrequired miner training. \nIndependent  contractors  working  on  mine  property  must  comply  with \nthe requirements of Part 46 (see \"§ 46.12 Responsibility for Independent \nContractor  Training\").

Why is there a difference in the time required to make a training plan available \nfor inspection and the time required to make training certificates available for \ninspection?  \nTraining  plans  must  be  made  available  within  one  business  day,  but  training \nrecords, and certificates with the signature of the person responsible for health \nand safety training must be made available before inspection activity at the mine \nconcludes for the day.  The reason for the difference is a matter of urgency.  If a \nminer is untrained or improperly trained, it is a hazard to the miner and to other \nminers.    You  must  make  the  training  records  and  certificates  available  to  the \ninspector   at   the   mine   site.      The   inspector   may   choose,   as   a   matter   of \nconvenience,  to  inspect  the  records  at  the  office  or  location  where  the  records \nare  maintained  or  have  them  faxed  to  an  MSHA  office  for  his  or  her  inspection \nthat day. \n112. Are  new  miners  required  to  keep  copies  of  their  training  certificates  on  their \nperson for inspection by MSHA personnel? \nNo.      Production-operators   and   independent   contractors,   not   miners,   are \nresponsible  for  making  and  maintaining  required  miner  training  records  and \ncertificates, and producing the records and certificates upon request by MSH","position":{"index":282,"start_char":151200,"end_char":152700},"metadata":{"content_hash":"38fac214e2023141"},"created_at":"2025-12-24T19:13:05.986Z"}

What  training  must  new  miners  receive  to  become  \"experienced  miners,\"  and \nwho can give the training? \n \nLike the old rule, the new miner training must be approved by MSHA and given by \nan  MSHA-approved  instructor.    As  in  the  past,  this  training  can  be  provided  by \nmany   sources,   including   the   mine   operator,   the   State,   universities,   trade \nassociations, and independent trainers. \n \n197\n\n \n14.Miners,  particularly  supervisors,  sometimes  conduct  Part  48  training.

Exactly what training must supervisors now have under the new rule? \n \nThe new rule requires that all supervisors be treated like other miners for training \npurposes.

Also, \nthe miner must receive training that covers major changes affecting safety \nor  health  that  have  occurred  at  the  mine,  before  the  miner  starts  work. \nThis training may be credited toward the miner's annual refresher training.\n \n2.When  an  experienced  miner  returns  to  the  mine  following  an  absence  of\nmore  than  12  months,  the  operator  must  provide  experienced  miner\ntraining  before the  miner  begins  work.    This  starts  a new  annual  refresher\ntraining date for this miner.\n59.What is MSHA’s definition of extraction and production?\n\"Extraction  and  production\"  refers  to  the  process  of  mining  and  removal  of \ncoal  or  ore  from  a  mine.    This  process  includes  both  the  mechanical  and \nchemical  separating  of  coal  from  the  surrounding  rock  and  metal  or  valuable \nminerals  from  ore  and  concentrate;  removal  and  milling  of  conglomerates  or \nrocks  by  crushing,  screening,  or  sizing;  and  haulage  associated  with  these \nprocesses. \n214\n\nTRAINING\tPLAN\t\nThis section provides guidance to help you (mine owners and operators) develop your \nMSHA required Part 48 training plan(s).  In some cases, independent contractors must \ndevelop their own training plan.  State grantees and others may also develop their own \nplan. \nAll coal mines, all underground metal and nonmetal mines, and ot","position":{"index":486,"start_char":426600,"end_char":428100},"metadata":{"content_hash":"00a8d1e50ec1c44f"},"created_at":"2025-12-24T19:13:05.989Z"}
